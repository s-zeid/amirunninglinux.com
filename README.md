This was made as a parody of [Microsoft's now-defunct Windows 8.1 marketing
site, amirunningxp.com][amirunningxp].  It's not foolproof, as it uses user
agent detection, but it usually works, and it looks shiny, and it also has
some informative text as to why Linux is good and how to get it.  Written
in PHP.

There's also [an Android app][amirunninglinux.apk], which obviously always
answers yes and was intended as a joke.
