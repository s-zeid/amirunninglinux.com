This was made as a parody of [Microsoft's amirunningxp.com][amirunningxp].  It's
not foolproof, as it uses user agent detection, but it usually works, and it
looks shiny, and it also has some informative text as to why Linux is good and
how to get it.  Written in PHP.

There's also [an Android app](http://code.s.zeid.me/amirunninglinux.apk), which
obviously always answers yes and was intended as a joke.
